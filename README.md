# bingo

## Getting started
- Install dependencies using 'npm install'
- Run the codebase in development mode using 'npm run dev'
- or use 'npm build' followed by 'npm run'.

## src/index.ts
Main entry point. Prints info to use to win against the bingo-obsessed squid. You should choose the card that has the least number of calls ('numCalls'), to ensure that you win against the squid. Poor squid.

## src/classes/BingoCard.ts
Class that encapsulates most of the main Bingo logic.
